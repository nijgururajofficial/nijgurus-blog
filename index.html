				<h3>Artwork Personalization at Netflix</h3>
				<p>For many years, the main goal of the Netflix personalized recommendation system has been to get the right titles in front each of our members at the right time. With a catalog spanning thousands of titles and a diverse member base spanning over a hundred million accounts, recommending the titles that are just right for each member is crucial. But the job of recommendation does not end there. Why should you care about any particular title we recommend? What can we say about a new and unfamiliar title that will pique your interest? How do we convince you that a title is worth watching? Answering these questions is critical in helping our members discover great content, especially for unfamiliar titles. One avenue to address this challenge is to consider the artwork or imagery we use to portray the titles. If the artwork representing a title captures something compelling to you, then it acts as a gateway into that title and gives you some visual “evidence” for why the title might be good for you. </p>

				<h3>This Is How Google Will Collapse</h3>
				<p>It's difficult to predict the future of any tech giant, but some experts believe that Google could collapse if it fails to adapt to changing trends and user behavior. One potential threat is the rise of privacy concerns and data protection laws, which could limit Google's ability to collect and use personal data for advertising. Another potential risk is increased competition from newer and more innovative companies. Google may struggle to keep up with the latest trends and technologies if it becomes too focused on its existing products and services. Finally, internal problems such as employee unrest or leadership disputes could also contribute to Google's downfall. Despite these challenges, Google has a strong track record of adapting to changing circumstances and continuing to innovate, so it remains to be seen if and when such a collapse could occur.</p>
